            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <p>Gimbiya Capital is a London-based
                entrepreneurial investment firm
                with a simple goal: to acquire and
                grow a single great business for the
                long term. We are not a private equity
                fund. We do not flip businesses.
                We roll up our sleeves and become
                true owner-operators.

            <h3>what we beleive</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Businesses are built by people who
                    care, and they should be run
                    by people who care just as much</li>
                <li>
                    . A good succession plan is more
                    than a deal. It is about trust,
                    respect, and carrying forward the
                    values that made a business strong
                </li>
                <li>3. Sustainable growth happens when
                    you invest in people, processes, and
                    the communities your business serves</li>

            <p>Bolutife Babalola founded Gimbiya Capital with a deep belief that the most enduring businesses are built
                by those who truly understand the engine room — not just the boardroom. Inspired by his parents’
                entrepreneurial journey and grounded in his own experience across engineering, operations, and business
                transformation, Bolutife is committed to partnering with founders who care deeply about what they’ve
                built. Gimbiya Capital exists to support those seeking a thoughtful successor — someone who will honour
                their legacy, protect their team, and grow the business with the same dedication and purpose that built
                it in the first place.</p>
